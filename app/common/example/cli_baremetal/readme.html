<h1>CLI Bare metal application</h1>
<p>This example project demonstrates use of the command line interface component 
in a bare metal environment.</p>
<p>The user can use the command line interface over the VCOM serial port. 
The example provides three commands, echo_str, echo_int and led.</p>
<p>echo_str simply echoes back the input arguments as strings.
echo_int parses the input arguments as integers before echoing them back.
led allows the user to turn on, turn off or toggle the leds on the board.</p>
