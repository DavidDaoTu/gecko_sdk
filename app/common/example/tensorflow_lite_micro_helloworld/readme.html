<h1>TensorFlow Lite Micro - Hello World</h1>
<p>This application demonstrates a model trained to replicate a sine function. 
The model is continuously fed with values ranging from 0 to 2pi, and the output 
of the model is used to control the intensity of an LED. Inference results are 
also printed over VCOM. </p>
<p>This is a port of TensorFlow's hello world application. For details about the 
application or information on how to train your own model, visit the TensorFlow Lite Micro
