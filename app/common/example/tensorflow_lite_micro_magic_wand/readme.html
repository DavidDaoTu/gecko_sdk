<h1>TensorFlow Lite Micro - Magic Wand </h1>
<p>This application demonstrates a model trained to recognize various hand gestures with an accelerometer. The detected gestures are printed to the serial port.</p>
<p>With the board facing up, and the USB cable pointed towards you, you should be able to perform one of the three gestures: Wing (*W*), Ring (*O*), or Slope (*L*) and have them correctly detected and output to the serial port. The detection works best when the board is mounted to the end of a wand, or similar. The LEDs should also light up to indicate a detected gesture.</p>
<p>This application is a port of TensorFlow's Magic Wand application. For details about the application or information on how to train a model of your own, see TensorFlow Lite Micro's <strong><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/tree/3e190e5389be49c94475e509452bdae245bd4fa6/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/magic_wand">GitHub page</a></strong>.</p>
