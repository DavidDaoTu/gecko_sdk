<h1>TensorFlow Lite Micro - Micro Speech</h1>
<p>This application demonstrates a model trained to recognize the words "yes" and 
"no" from speech data recorded from the microphone. The detected keywords are 
transmitted over VCOM. LED 0 is toggled every time model inference is performed 
to give an indication of the processing speed of the model.</p>
<p>This application is a port of TensorFlow's micro speech application. For details
