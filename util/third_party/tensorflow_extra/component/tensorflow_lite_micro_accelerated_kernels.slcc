label: TensorFlow Lite Micro MVP Accelerated Kernels
description: >
  This component includes kernel implementations that are accelerated on MVP
  (Matrix Vector Processor) hardware. By including this component, the MVP
  kernel implementations will be used instead of the optimized kernels.

  The kernels which have MVP accelerated implementations are:
    pooling, fully_connected, add, conv and depthwise_conv.
  Remaining kernels fallback to use optimized or reference kernel
  implementations.
